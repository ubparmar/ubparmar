# 🔥 Full-Stack Sorcerer | AI Whisperer | Prompt Engineer 😈  

💀 **"I don’t just write code—I make machines think."** 💀  

### 🚀 Welcome to My Digital Battleground 🎮  

👨‍💻 I build, I break, I optimize. Whether it's **web apps that run like rockets** 🚀 or **AI that obeys like a well-trained assassin**, I make sure every line of code has **purpose, speed, and attitude**.

## ⚔️ **Tech Arsenal** – No Boring Stuff Here  
🔥 **Web Dev:** Laravel | Livewire | Blade | Tailwind  
⚡ **AI & ML:** TensorFlow | PyTorch | OpenAI API (Yes, I make AI talk back)  
🎭 **Prompt Engineering:** Jailbreaking LLMs, crafting hyper-intelligent prompts, and making AI do things it *wasn’t supposed to do*.  

🛠️ **Automation Obsessed:** If it takes more than 3 clicks, I script it.

## 💀 **What I Do?**
- **Code that’s fast, deadly, and optimized to perfection.**  
- **Web apps that don’t just work—they dominate.**  
- **AI models that don’t just answer—they predict the question.**  
- **LLMs that don’t just generate text—they tell you secrets.**  

💡 **Motto:** *If I can automate it, I will. If I can hack it, I will. If I can optimize it, I already did.*
