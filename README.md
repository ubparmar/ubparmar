# 🖥️🔥 Code Wizard | AI Architect | Web Dev Sorcerer 😈  

💀 **"I don’t just write code. I engineer digital chaos."** 💀  

### 🚀 Welcome to My Digital Dojo 🥋  

I build, break, and reassemble the digital world one commit at a time.  
👨‍💻 Full-stack sorcery meets **AI-driven mayhem**—because why just code when you can build *intelligent* machines?

## 🛠️ **Tech Arsenal** – Because Vanilla is for Ice Cream 🍦  
🎯 **Web Dev**: Laravel | Livewire | React | Tailwind | Node.js  
🧠 **AI/ML**: TensorFlow | PyTorch | OpenAI API (Yes, I make AIs talk)  
📊 **Data Science**: Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | SciPy  
⚡ **DevOps**: Docker | GitHub Actions | CI/CD | Linux (I talk to servers in Bash)  

📝 **Prompt Engineering**:  
I don’t just ask AI questions—I make it *spill secrets* 🔥. From **jailbreaking** chatbots to crafting **hyper-optimized prompts**, I bend LLMs to my will.  
Ever seen an AI generate code, fix its own mistakes, and then apologize? You’re looking at the guy who made it happen. 😈
