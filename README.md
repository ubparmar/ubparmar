# 🔥 Full-Stack Sorcerer | AI Whisperer | Prompt Engineer 😈  

💀 **"I don’t just write code—I make machines question their existence."** 💀  

### 🚀 Welcome to My Digital Battleground 🎮  

👨‍💻 I build, I break, I optimize. Whether it's **web apps that load before you blink** or **AI that gives better life advice than your therapist**, I make sure every line of code has **purpose, speed, and attitude**.  

💡 **Fun Fact:** I once wrote a bug so complex that Stack Overflow moderators sent me an apology email.
